# cryptFun
Basic javascript Node app that encrypts or decrypts files.
This program creates SHA256 from password input and uses the hash as the key to encrypt/decrypt the file.

### What I've Learned
* Node.js File System Module for manipulating files.
* Node.js Crypto Module for creating and using SHA256 hash.
* Node.js Readline Module for process input and output.
